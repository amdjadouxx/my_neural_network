# My Neural Network

This project implements neural networks from scratch, providing a flexible framework for building and training custom neural network architectures.

## Features

- Fully connected layers
- Activation layers with various activation functions
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Customizable loss functions
- Training with backpropagation
- Model saving and loading

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

# NEXT_STEPS

==> other main to resolve problem to check fiability (no image because no cnn)

==> cnn for mnist better result

==> optimizer implementation

==> gui

==> auto fine-tuning

Don't hesitate to take a look at this simple but reallly usefull project to improve in neural network understanding :)
